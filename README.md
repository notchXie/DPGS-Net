# DPGS-Net: Dual Prior-Guided Cross-Domain Adaptive Framework for Ultrasound Image Segmentation

> Official PyTorch implementation of our method proposed in the paper:  
> **"Dual Prior-Guided Two-Stage Framework for Small-Sample Ultrasound Image Segmentation"**  
> ðŸ“Œ Accepted/Submitted to MICCAI 2025  
> ðŸ“… Project based on the DDTI dataset and others for medical ultrasound image segmentation.

## ðŸ§  Overview

Ultrasound image segmentation is crucial for medical-assisted diagnosis but faces challenges like:

- High noise and image artifacts  
- Large morphological variation across views  
- Feature contradiction due to different acquisition angles  
- Difficulty generalizing under small-sample data conditions

To tackle these, we propose a **Dual Prior-Guided Cross-Domain Adaptive Framework**, which enhances segmentation robustness and generalization under limited data.
